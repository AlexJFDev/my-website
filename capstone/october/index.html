      <p>This month I was asked to write about what I am doing to have a successful experience and who is supporting me.</p>
      <p>My main support at my Capstone organization is my supervisor. He has done the onboarding process with me and he is meant to be my first contact for any questions or issues that I have. Secondary support might be my dad; he also works at my Capstone organization but is in a different department.</p>
      <p>To be successful in my Capstone I am trying to show initiative. One way I can demonstrate initiative is by asking lots of questions. This shows my interest and that I am paying attention to what I am being told. I can showcase my skills by speaking up when I am familiar with a concept and doing tasks on my own without needing guidance. This could apply to my skills in programming, networking, and use.</p>
