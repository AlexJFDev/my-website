      <p>For November I was asked to write about challenges I have encountered in my Capstone.</p>
      <p>Overall my Capstone has gone pretty smoothly and I haven’t encountered any major obstacles. But, I have run into small problems with projects that I’ve been assigned. So far this year I have been assigned to inspect conference rooms every week, design a new configuration for computers in conference rooms, and update web pages.</p>
      <p>The first issue I ran into was during my conference room inspections. The microphone on one of the computers I looked at was not working. When some basic troubleshooting didn’t fix it I let my manager know. A few days later, my manager and I checked the problem out together. The microphone still wasn’t working. Eventually, my manager found the microphone in a cabinet at the back of the room. Someone had unplugged it and put it there.</p>
      <p>This experience taught me more about troubleshooting. I learned what to do when I can’t solve a problem and that it is okay to ask my manager for help.</p>
