      <p>This month I was asked to write about the technical skills that I've used at my Capstone.</p>
      <p>So far, I have had a lot of programming to do. In particular I have been writing powershell scripts to automate computer setup. I learned about scripting in my 10th grade class when we learned Python. The syntax for Powershell is more primitive but logically it works the same as python. Both languages are also object oriented.</p>
      <p>More generally I've used my skills in algorithms as well. I wrote an algorithm in JavaScript for a webpage and have made algorithms for my PowerShell scripts too. The JavaScript algorithm was pretty simple but the PowerShell one was more advanced. The Powershell script takes a JSON file and uses it to update registry entries. It uses conditional statements, guard clauses, and for loops.</p>
