      <p>Last year I started a garden in my backyard (which I will write about in the future) and after having decent success with it decided that I start another garden this year. My garden is located in my families backyard in a corner that, last year, I had cleared from bushes, vines, and weeds. My goal for this years garden was to expand, plant more plants, and do a better job of keeping up with weeding and watering. I've done an alright job of keeping up to these goals though it hasn't been as good as I had hoped.</p>
      <p>The biggest change between this year and last is probably in the chicken wire fence that I put up around my garden to protect it from animals. When I put up the fence last year I was rushed and did a bad job of it. By the start of this summer the fence was in pretty bad shape. What I did was to take the whole fence down and then take my time putting it back up. To provide a structure for the fence to rest on I used bamboo stakes that I'd driven several feet into the ground. Compared to my fence from last year the new one has held up a lot better. I've also incorporated a "gate" into it which makes it easier to bring things like the lawnmower into my garden space</p>
      <p>I also have some different plants from what I have last year. Last year I planted corn, tomatoes, carrots, cantaloupe, and watermelon. This year I have corn, tomatoes (some of which are volunteers descended from last years), cucumber, chard, an unknown variety of melon or squash, basil, mint (volunteers), and dill. Additionally there were a lot of seeds that I planted that never sprouted that had come from my grandmothers collection of seeds. These seeds from my grandmother were very old and had gone bad. I had also tried planting peppers from seeds that I had received as a gift last year but those had gone bad too.</p>
