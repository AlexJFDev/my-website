    </div>
    <div id="main-section">
      <p>There are many different devices to save data. Each way to save data be fit into one of two catagories, storage and memory.</p>
      <h2>Memory</h2>
      <p>Memory is used for data that needs to be accessed very quickly. There are two subtypes of memory. RAM (random-access memory) and ROM (read only memory).</p>
      <h3>ROM</h3>
      <p>As the name implies ROM is used for data that does not need to be overwritten. It is also faster than RAM. This makes ROM cheaper and faster than RAM but, because of its limitations, ROM can only be used to store very basic firmware for your computer.</p>
      <h3>RAM</h3>
      <p>Unlike ROM RAM can be overwritten. This means that RAM is the main type of memory in your computer. The drawback to RAM is that it is volatile meaning that the data stored in RAM does not persist when power is lost.</p>
      <h4>SRAM</h4>
      <p>SRAM is static random-access memory. It has special circuitry that makes it faster than DRAM but this makes it larger and more expensive. Because of the cost, SRAM is only used in small amounts for CPU's cache.</p>
      <p>In consumer CPUs SRAM cache can reach speeds of greater than 3 TB/s.</p>
      <h4>DRAM</h4>
      <p>DRAM is dynamic random-access memory. Dynamic means that even with power it does not hold its state for long because of this it has to be periodically refreshed. Since DRAM is cheaper than SRAM but still very fast it is the main type of RAM used in computers.</p>
      <p> The fastest consumer DRAM chips have a max speed of 51.2 GB/s.</p>
      <h2>Storage</h2>
      <p>Storage can be used for data that does not to be accessed as quickly and for the long term. Storage is cheaper than RAM and because of this it is the main way to save data on a computer.</p>
      <h4>Hard Disk Drives</h4>
      <p>Hard Disk Drives are a kind of storage that use magnetic discs to save data. The discs spin around inside the drive and an arm reads and writes data by changing the polarity of sections of the disc.</p>
      <h4>Solid State Drives</h4>
      <p>Solid State Drives use flash chips to store data. This makes them faster but more expensive than HDDs. However, the difference in price between the two kinds of storage is shrinking and SSDs are frequently used in place of HDDs.</p>
