      <p>In CSC-205 one of the things we will be doing is working on <a href="https://github.com/AllenDowney/DSIRP">DSIRP</a>. Its a course designed to teach about algorithms and data structures in Python.</p>
        <p> Our first assignment was to work on <a href="https://github.com/AllenDowney/DSIRP/blob/main/notebooks/algorithms.ipynb">algorithms</a> which teaches basic algorithm concepts. Its first task is to find if two words are anagrams.</p>
        <h2>My First Approach</h2>
        <pre><code>
          def is_anagram_old(word1, word2):
            # `word1` is a string.
            # `word2` is a string.
            # Create dictionaries
            word1Letters = {}
            word2Letters = {}
            # Iterate over word1
            for letter in word1:
              # Using 'letter' as a key get a value from the dictionary. If the key does not yet exist get 0. 
              # Add 1 to this value and put it back in the dictionary.
              word1Letters[letter] = word1Letters.get(letter, 0) + 1
            # Iterate over word2
            for letter in word2:
              # Using 'letter' as a key get a value from the dictionary. If the key does not yet exist get 0. 
              # Add 1 to this value and put it back in the dictionary.
              word2Letters[letter] = word2Letters.get(letter, 0) + 1
            # Compare the dictionaries; if they are equal return True.
            if word1Letters != word2Letters: return False
            # Return False
            return True
        </code></pre>
        <p>This first method takes a more conventional approach using dictionaries.</p>
        <h3>My Second Approach</h3>
        <pre><code>
          def factorize_word(word, letter_dictionary): 
            # `word` is just a string. 
            # `letter_dictionary` is a dictionary with single characters as keys and prime numbers as values.
            # Start with 1
            factorized_word = 1
            # Iterate over the word
            for letter in word:
              # Using `letter` as the key get a prime number from the `letter_dictionary`. 
              # Multiply 'factorized_word' by that prime number.
              factorized_word *= letter_dictionary.get(letter)
            # Return factorized_word
            return factorized_word

          def is_anagram(word1, word2):
            # Factorize word1
            word1_factorized = factorize_word(word1, filled_letter_dictionary)
            # Factorize word2
            word2_factorized = factorize_word(word2, filled_letter_dictionary)
            # Return False if the factorizes aren't equal.
            if word1_factorized != word2_factorized: return False
            # Return True
            return True
        </code></pre>
        <p>This method is less conventional but it seems to be slightly faster.</p>
        <p>I call this method "factorizing". Every letter is associated with a different prime number ({"a":2,"b":3,"c":5,...}). The algorithm finds all the prime numbers of a word and multiplies them together. Anagrams will always have the same prime numbers and therefore the same product.</p>
        <p>This method works because each number has a unique set of prime factors.</p>
